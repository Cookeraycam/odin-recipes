    <p>An enchilada is a Mexican dish that's made from tortillas wrapped around meat or cheese, and cooked in a spicy
        sauce. The earliest enchiladas were simply a plain tortilla served with chili sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground beef (at least 80% lean)
        </li>
        <li>2 cans (10 oz each) Old El Paso™ red enchilada sauce</li>
        <li>1 can (4.5 oz) Old El Paso™ chopped green chiles</li>
        <li>1 package (8.2 oz) Old El Paso™ flour tortillas for soft tacos & fajitas (6 inch)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese (6 oz)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 375°F. Spray 13x9-inch (3-quart) baking dish or pan with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>In 10-inch nonstick skillet, cook beef over medium-high heat 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until
            thoroughly cooked; drain. Stir in 1/2 cup of the enchilada sauce and the chiles.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/2 cup of the enchilada sauce evenly in baking dish. Spread 1/4 cup beef mixture down center of each
            tortilla; sprinkle with 1 tablespoon cheese. Wrap tortillas tightly around filling, placing seam side down
            in baking dish. Top with remaining enchilada sauce. Sprinkle with remaining cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until hot and bubbly. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.</li>
